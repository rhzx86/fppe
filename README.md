# fppe

Small physics engine implemented with fixed point numbers, meaning it is completely deterministic across all architectures.

This library is a port of c library [tinyphysicsengine](https://codeberg.org/drummyfish/tinyphysicsengine) using [fixed](https://crates.io/crates/fixed) and [cordic](https://crates.io/crates/cordic) crates.

**NOTE: The library is not complete and there are only two examples ported from original library and there are probably bugs**
